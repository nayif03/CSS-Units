             <p>
                I want to tell you the story of the greatest lesson in history, which you probably don’t know. It’s the one the 20th century is trying to teach the 21st — but we, blinded by ideologies, weary and failing ways of thinking about the world, society, and ourselves, are still only just barely struggling to grasp it — if we are not resisting it outright. After all, we are not even twenty years into this century — so it’s no surprise the last one’s greatest lesson is yet unlearned.
             </p>
             <p>
                There’s a question that’s as old as time. How do we build ciities, countries, towns, societies — worlds, lives — which prosper, endure, soar? Some said — the brutish and the shallow, mostly: “We gain by taking what is theirs! Let us enslave and exploit them! Why, they are not people at all!” And then cooler and wiser minds replied, shaking their heads: “No, no. We mustn’t do that. We must lift everyone up — and everyone is a person — never pull anyone down.” So. Shall we prosper by exploitation — or through liberation? Through subjugation and slavery, through hate and violence — or their opposites, equality, freedom, justice? Here’s a fact. Nobody really knew. So we humans, being the blind things we are, settled for the best we could: we debated it for millennia, with more and abstruse and abstract theories of morality, ethics, politics, economics. Here’s another fact. We didn’t know the answer — until now.
             </p>
             <p>
                I was amused — if not surprised — to read, somewhere in a little corner of the internet, a description of myself as a socialist. In that accusatory way that Americans — at least some of them, on the fringe — still use the word. Amused because, well — let me describe my politics to you. My politics are very simple. I try not to have any. LOL — what? I’m sure that leaves many of you bewildered, even surprised. “But you’re always going on about capitalism and — “ Very true, so I do. So what in blazes do I mean?
             </p>
             <p>
                You could in one way describe my politics, if you are very insistent of putting people in little boxes and neatly labelling them, this way. I suppose that I’m a pretty ordinary kind of social democrat — the kind that most people who aren’t Americans, but live in rich countries, are, from Europe to Canada. I think that the superior social contract at this juncture in human history is simple and straightforward — and that it is is a kind of minor miracle in itself, which I’ll return to. That social contract goes like this: people provide one another the basics of a good life in modern terms, which means healthcare, education, some minimal income and savings, retirement, and so on. Capitalism — at a human scale — takes care of the luxuries.
             </p>
             <p>
                But these aren’t “my politics” in the sense that people usually mean the term. They are not my beliefs, moral, social, cultural, and so on, based on theories of some such and this that, which I am trying to push on you, to persuade you of, mistakes to correct in you. They are not beliefs — things I don’t know, but presume, or hope, or wish to be true — in any whatsoever (and that is why you will see that I don’t play the games of persuasion and so on that American pundits do.) So if they aren’t my beliefs, then what are they?
             </p>
             <p>
                They are facts. Nothing more and nothing less. Just facts. It is a fact that people are happier in social democracies. It is a fact that people are richer, wealthier, closer, live longer, saner, better lives, in nearly every regard. There is nothing subjective or unknown about that statement, and so it is not a belief in any way whatsoever. Do you see the difference here — between fact and belief? You might think that I’m splitting hairs — but I think that both the future, and the greatest lesson in human history that you probably don’t know lie right here.
             </p>
             <p>
                Why? Let me explain backwards. What’s unique about America? It’s that it got the social contract of modernity, which I described above — people provide each other the necessities, and capitalism provides the luxuries — absolutely backwards. America, unique amongst rich nations — all nations, in fact, tried a social contract where capitalism provides people the necessities, and the luxuries, things like yachts and mansions and so forth, are often had by way of a kind of weird, inverse socialism — cronyism, how close you are to powerful politicians and capitalists and so on, how many subsidies you can grab, how much you take from others.
             </p>
             <p>
                In other words, America has always been testing the hypothesis that more exploitation leads to more prosperity. First, it did it through slavery, and then through segregation, and now, through capitalism. Milder forms, maybe — yet the principle remains the same. So what do the results say? I’ll come to that.
             </p>
             <p>
                Now, it doesn’t take a genius to have said: hey, listen…this social contract probably isn’t going to work out. Not only does capitalism have no incentive, reason, or motive to provide people the necessities, if the way to get rich is by everyone exploiting everyone else in the first place — then a society will never really go anywhere at all. And that is exactly what happened in America during my whole adult lifetime. Society literally went nowhere.
             </p>
             <p>
                I mean that in the hardest possible terms. Society literally went nowhere. Incomes went nowhere. Life expectancy fell. Social mobility dropped. Depression and suicide rose. And so on. Along every indicator you can imagine or think of, America has made zero progress during my whole adult lifetime. That is not a belief. It is not my opinion, it is not a subject for debate — it is simply a fact. America tried out yet another social contract based on exploitation — capitalism, after segregation and slavery — whose results were as predictable then as they are real today: as people grew poorer, they turned to authoritarianism, instability became collapse, and here we are today, hoping a Blue Wave will stem the tide.
             </p>
             <p>
                Nothing I have told you so far has been a matter of belief, in any way whatsoever. We are merely in the realm of facts, of empirical realities, of objectively verified truths. So nothing I have to say is about my political “beliefs”. Do you see the link? Now. Why don’t I try to have political beliefs? After all, everyone else seems to. Well, to be honest, nothing (nothing) bores me more than politics and economics. What do I love? I love disco, old French movies, fashion, and psychology (I know, it sounds like a bad dating profile.) My “beliefs”, such as they are, have to do with those things. I “believe” that a minor seventh chord makes everything a little better.
             </p>
             <p>
                But if I start “believing” things about political economy, about society, about the world, then what happens? I can’t do my job very well if I “believe” things to be true, instead of know them, can I? Then I go from being something like an observer — or maybe intellectual, or maybe just an educated person, or maybe just a civilized one, you can choose — to being something more like a fool, someone who has rejected knowing, scorned truth. Do you see the problem here? It applies to you, too.
             </p>
             <p>
                So why are we cursed with this burden of political beliefs? Why can’t more of us simply let go of beliefs — and say — whatever labels and ideologies the world, my society, my culture has trained and taught me to “believe” in, I will hold them lightly, tentatively, skeptically? Strangely, if you think about it, we can’t shed the burden of belief because it is a new thing to be able not to have political “beliefs.” Think about the world. Until the 1970s or so, it was eminently reasonable to say something like — “Who knows? Maybe capitalism is better. Maybe communism is! Maybe authoritarianism is. Or maybe apartheid states are the best kind to be! Who knows how the average person will be better off?” You see, we didn’t have much evidence about much at all, when it came to different modes and models of political economy, society, social contracts, and so forth.
             </p>
             <p>
                Let me put that to you much more starkly. We could have said, probably until the 1970s or so, that America was a rich and powerful nation — and it was still segregated. Furthermore, it had gotten rich through slavery as much or more as through innovation. Europe, too, was still rising from the ashes of war — at that point, Spain was still a military dictatorship, and Germany still a split, riven nation. Who was to say which system was better, out of all the many choices political economy had to offer? Remember my question? It’s as old as time.
             </p>
             <p>
                How do we build societies which prosper? Shall we do it through exploitation — or through liberation? Through subjugation and slavery, through hate and violence? Or shall we do it through equality, freedom, and justice? Nobody really knew. Until now.
             </p>
             <p>
                Over the last fifty years or so, a revolution hidden in plain sight has taken place in the world — which has gone too often unnoticed — and especially not American intellectuals, which is why Americans are in the dark about it (even though they intuitively get it, a full 70% of them can be described today as something like emerging social democrats anyways.) That miracle was this — European social democracy began to pioneer history’s highest living standards ever, period, full stop. Within fifty years — just fifty years! — less than one human lifetime, shattered, wrecked societies like Germany, Spain, and France had achieved the following things: the world’s longest lifespans, richest and largest middle classes, most equitable distributions of wealth, and so on. Scandinavia, taking it further, built history’s, and the world’s happiest, most egalitarian, and wealthiest societies.
             </p>
             <p>
                In other words, social democracy was revealed to be something that human beings had been searching desperately, bitterly for — forever. The missing link human beings had been seeking for since the beginning, really, of civilization.
             </p>
             <p>
                Does prosperity come from exploitation — or from liberation? No one knew. Hence, millennia of bitter debates, about morality, religion, society, and so on — which simmered until the boiled over, finally, in a century of grand social experiments. American capitalism, Soviet communism, German fascism, and so on. That century was the last one.
             </p>
             <p>
                Now, We are the beneficiaries of the truths it has revealed, my friends. But if we do not care to learn them, then we are worse than fools — we are ingrates, too. Those truths go something like this.
             </p>
             <p>
                The hypothesis that America is still testing, if we are blunt, is still the same old one: exploitation leads to prosperity, only in the softer form of capitalism, rather than slavery and segregation. But post-war Europe tested a very different one. Exploitation and abuse would lead to ruin — it was liberation and gentleness and investment that would lead to prosperity. Who was right? What do the results of history say?
             </p>
             <p>
                The system that resulted in Europe, which came to be called “social democracy”, was revealed to be the most powerful lever of human possibility that had been discovered, ever. It was so powerful, in fact, that it made an impoverished, ruined Europe more prosperous in every single way than America in a single human lifetime.
             </p>
             <p>
                Now, it’s equally important to understand the rejection, if you like, of the alternate hypothesis. Since the beginning of time, human beings have been ruled by the most brutal and foolish among them — and such minds have said: “the way to prosperity is through enslaving and exploiting and abusing others! As long as we can get them to do our work, with the whip or the chain or the trinket — why, we will be kings!” America, sadly, has a tendency to listen to such minds, over and over again. Hence, the basics of the hypothesis it has been testing have always remained more or less the same — prosperity results from exploitation.
             </p>
             <p>
                But American collapse tells us that exploitation does not lead to prosperity. It leads to poverty amidst grotesque amounts of plenty, like having to choose between medicine and shelter even if you’re “middle class””, that is, profound and terrible inequality, which causes instability, which sparks authoritarianism, and so on.
             </p>
             <p>
                    Now. Since the beginning of time, we’ve had a battle of ideas, of ways, of paths. The simple-minded and cruel and selfish among us have said — “prosperity comes from exploitation! Conquer, enslave, pillage!” America — like too many nations before it, most in fact — listened to them. Wiser and cooler minds have said — “no, prosperity comes from equality, from freedom, from justice — from people investing in one another, so that they can all be educated, healthy, sane, happy, and sovereign.” Who was to say who was right? Far fewer nations ever chose the second path than the first, didn’t they? It wasn’t until after the last great War that we really had enough evidence to judge which side was right, in this battle that is as old as time.
             </p>
             <p>
                    But we do now. The evidence is in. Prosperity does not come from exploitation — that is the single simple reason behind American collapse. Prosperity comes from the opposite of exploitation, which I’ve called liberation, but in truth, is still something we don’t have a good word for, so deeply ingrained into our histories and minds is the idea that exploitation is good and necessary — so often, we just call it “social democracy”, by which we mean people investing in each others’ expansion, self-realization, possibilities.
             </p>
             <p>
                    That breakthrough in knowledge is something they don’t really discuss in America — it’s like an open secret about an unmentionable fact. They don’t teach it at school, in college, on the news, in the books. They don’t frame it as the momentous, historic, groundbreaking quantum leap in human understanding that it really is. They don’t tell you that it is one of the greatest facts that has ever been learned by the human race — and every single human being who calls themselves educated and civilized must and should know it. Why? Because if they don’t, they’re likely to repeat history — instead of advance it — aren’t they?
             </p>
             <p>
                    That’s why America is where it is. It is a nation, sadly, which is largely ignorant, by design, of the greatest fact in the world, one of the greatest facts in history: that we have the missing formula for human prosperity, finally, after millennia of strife and war and hate and ruin. It’s simple. Prosperity comes from liberation, not exploitation. That formula — or that recipe — is at this point in human history, an empirical reality, an objectively verifiable set of truths, not a matter of belief or chance or ideology anymore. Why would you want to be ignorant of a lesson that meaningful, great, and crucial?
             </p>
             <p>
                    That is why I try not to have politics, my friends. Politics are largely empty vessels, hopefully obsolete things, in this day and age, really. The future won’t be made with people with political beliefs, as it was yesterday. That is because we have stark evidence about those beliefs, finally, after all the long midnights of human history — all the slavery, all the hatred, all the whips and all the chains. Where did they lead? Upwards — or downwards? Did exploitation lead to riches — or to ruin? The answer couldn’t be any more obvious — though for most of human history, it was as opaque, as unknown, as the face of the sun. All that we could do was debate it morally, philosophically, and so on. Until a century of grand social experiments came. Are we wise enough to learn its truths?
             </p>
             <p>
                    Today — this juncture in human history — really is different. We don’t need to believe, like blind people, anymore — to guess and hope and wonder. We simply need to see what is front of our eyes. The future will be made, then, by radical pragmatists. Who can take history’s great lessons — and apply them. But that is only because they understand them.
